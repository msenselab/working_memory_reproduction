## Abstract

Duration estimates are often biased by the sampled statistical context, yielding classical central tendency effect, a phenomenon that shows short durations are overestimated and long duration underestimated. Most studies on the central tendency bias primarily focus on the integration process of the sensory measure and prior information, without considering any cognitive limits. Here we investigated the impact of cognitive load on duration estimation in the encoding and reproduction stages. In four experiments, observers were asked to perform a dual task: reproducing a given duration and recalling a memorized color patch. We found an increase of cognitive load during the encoding stage increased the central tendency bias but shortened the reproducted duration in general, while increasing the cognitive load during the reproduction stage prolonged the reproduced duration but did not influence the central tendency. By implementing the attentional sharing account into the hierarchical Bayesian model, we were able to predict both the general over- and under-estimation and the central tendency effects observed from all four experiments. The model suggests that memory pressure during the encoding stage increases the sensory noise, which elevates the central tendency effect. In contrast, memory pressure during the reproduction stage only influenced the perceived elapsed time, causing a general over-reproduction, but not the central tendency.
