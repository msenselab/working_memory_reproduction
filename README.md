## Abstract

It is known that a perceptual estimate of a magnitude integrates the current sensory evidence with the recent history of stimulus magnitudes, yielding the central tendency bias. A phenomenon shows short magnitudes are overestimated and long magnitudes underestimated. Most studies on the central tendency bias focus on the integration process, without considering any cognitive limits. Here we investigated the impact of cognitive load on duration perceiving and reproduction stages. In four experiments, observers were asked to perform a dual task: reproducing a given duration and recalling a memorized color patch. We found an increase of cognitive load during the perceiving stage increased the central tendency bias but shortened the reproducted duration, while cognitive load during the reproduction stage prolonged the reproduction duration but did not affect the central tendency bias. Using hierarchical Bayesian modelling, our results confirmed a differential impact of the memory pressure on the duration perceiving and reproduction stages.  1)  memory pressure in the encoding stage increases sensory noise which in turn affects Bayesian integration and leads to higher central tendency effect. By contrast, memory pressure during the reproduction stage did not significantly affect central tendency effect, suggesting the Bayesian integration likely occurs before the duration reproduction stage. 2) The concurrent memory task competes for the attentional resource that could be directed to the duration estimation, therefore leading to loss of time unit in duration perceiving or in monitoring the elapsed duration while reproducing a duration. As a result, increasing memory pressure in the perceiving stage caused more pronounced underestimation while the memory pressure in the reproduction stage caused stronger overestimation.
